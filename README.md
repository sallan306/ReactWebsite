This is my official Web Developer site.

## Technologies

React, bootstrap, react-awesome-button, waypoints, fontawesome.

I wanted an opportunity to do most things from scratch, so only a few minor efforts are from external NPM packages.
I created every React component and all of the javscript inside is of my own making, except the svg buttons in my Contact section.

I heavily modified svgs from various license free locations and converted them into react classes to change their properties based on the background selected.
